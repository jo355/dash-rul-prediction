# Remaining-Useful-Life Prediction on turbofan engine with Explainable AI
RUL prediction is performed on the NASA turbofan dataset: https://data.nasa.gov/Aerospace/CMAPSS-Jet-Engine-Simulated-Data/ff5v-kuh6
The framework used in this project, LSTM-TCN-xAI, is unexplored as of now for this application. The proposed ensemble model's results are compared with standalone LSTM and TCN.
